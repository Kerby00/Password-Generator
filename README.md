# Password-Generator
This repo contains the code for a password generator that I finished the javascript for. On this arrival to this page you will find a button that generates your random password. When clicking this button you will be met with a prompt asking multiple questions on your prefernce for your new password. A new password will be made based on your preferences and appears in the box above the generate button. Take a look at my java script to see how I did it. Thanks!
